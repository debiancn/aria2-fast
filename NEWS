aria2 1.24.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes several bugs.  The new functionality is that when
options which is only applicable in waiting state are submitted to an
active download via RPC, the download is now automatically restarted
to reflect the changes.  Previously, those options were just ignored.

Changes
-------

* BitTorrent: Allow 32KiB request

  It looks like the 32KiB is the default request size of python
  bittorrent client.  Previously, aria2 only allowed maximum 16KiB
  request.

* Don't unchoke peer which is not interested in us

* Fix bug that evaluation of Peer::amChoking is negated

* Faster seed/download on fast connection

* Increase DHT task concurrency to 15

  Fix GH-653

* Fixed mmap failure check with MAP_FAILED flag

  Fix GH-662

  Patch from suzker

* Added file size overflow check for mmap on 32bit os

  Fix GH-662

  Patch from suzker

* Use standard percent-encode for tracker request query

  Fix GH-659

* mingw32: Gain privilege before opening files

  Fix GH-657

* Restart active download to apply previously not applicable options

  Previously, we categorized options that can be used in
  aria2.changeOption RPC method into 2 categories.  The options in one
  category can be applied on the fly, meaning that download continues
  to be active while applying options.  Another category includes
  options which are only applicable when downloads are waiting or
  paused.

  In this change, when active download is ordered to change options
  which only applicable in waiting or paused state, it is now paused,
  and then automatically restarted.  Although we have limited number
  of download concurrency, the pause and restart is done atomically,
  and the download is inserted at the front of the queue, it is picked
  up immediately if the concurrency regulation allows.

  Fix GH-640 and GH-644
