aria2 1.15.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release adds JSON-RPC over WebSocket. It uses the same
request/response JSON objects with existing JSON-RPC over HTTP and
adds event notifications from server to client. See manpage for
details. TLS hostname check is rewritten based on RFC 6125 and it is
used for both GNUTLS and OpenSSL builds. The
--bt-remove-unselected-file option was added. This option removes the
unselected files when BitTorrent download is completed.

Changes
-------

* Use CreateProcessW instead of CreateProcessA in MinGW build.  This
  means filename is now passed as wchar string, not UTF-8 encoded char
  string.

* Check with pkg-config only: c-ares, openssl, sqlite3 and zlib.
  Removed --with-*-prefix configure option for c-ares, openssl,
  sqlite3, zlib and expat. Use CPPFLAGS and/or PKG_CONFIG_PATH
  instead.

* Fixed compile error with i686-w64-mingw32 and x86_64-w64-mingw32
  cross compilers.

* Get the home directory of the effective user ID using getpwuid() if
  $HOME is not defined.

* Don't use locale dependent toupper and tolower.

* Rewritten TLS hostname check based on RFC 6125 for both GNUTLS and
  OpenSSL builds.

* Added --bt-remove-unselected-file option.  Removes the unselected
  files when download is completed in BitTorrent. To select files, use
  --select-file option. If it is not used, all files are assumed to be
  selected. Please use this option with care because it will actually
  remove files from your disk.  This option is default to false.

* Fixed compile error on Open Solaris. Fixes bug#3497518

* Added JSON-RPC over WebSocket.

* Fixed assertion failure if Chunked encoding along with
  Content-Length is used.

* Fixed clang and gcc-4.7 warning and errors.

* Fixed the bug that aria2 cannot read line longer than 4096 bytes
  from the file specified by --input-file option. Fixes bug#3495336
