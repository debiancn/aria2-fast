aria2 1.19.0
============

Release Note
------------

This releases adds SFTP support, and fixes several bugs.  SFTP support
has been implemented using libssh2.  We added several new options.
--multiple-interface option is like --interface option, but can take
several interfaces.  They are used in round-robin manner, and it works
like link aggregation.  Previously, .netrc search path is fixed under
$HOME directory, and cannot be changed.  In this release, --netrc-path
option has been added to override the search path.  The runtime bug
concerning getrandom has been fixed in this release.  Previously if
download failed because checksum error, aria2 exited with error code 1
(unknown error).  Now it exits with dedicated error code 32.  We fixed
long outstanding bug that aria2 crashes when downloading multi-file
torrent.

Changes
-------

* android: Build and link with zlib

  Previously, we linked with zlib shipped with NDK, but it seems this
  is not part of NDK API, and thus could break our app.

* Allow netrc-path to be specified in the config file

  Adds --netrc-path to override default .netrc search path.  Patch
  from Ryan Steinmetz

* Exit with 32 status code if checksum verification failed

* Add SFTP support using libssh2

  aria2 can now download files via sftp protocol: aria2c sftp://....
  --ssh-host-key-md option is added to specify expected server's
  fingerprint.

* Added Dockerfile to cross complile aria2 for RaspberryPI (armhf)

  Patch from Igor Khomyakov

* multiple interface support for link aggregation

  Adds --multiple-interface option.  Patch from Sarim Khan

* Run on-bt-download-complete command when -V reports download finished

  Fixes GH-355

* Use dedicated DiskWriter in MultiDiskFileAllocationIterator

  We have to use dedicated DiskWriter instead of
  (*entryItr_)->getDiskWriter().  This is because
  SingleFileAllocationIterator cannot reopen file if file is closed by
  OpenedFileCounter.  Fixes GH-350

* Fix getrandom for system with libc not including errno or systems

  not supporting ENOSYS in the first place.  Fixes GH-347

  method

  See GH-241 for discussion

  Fxies GH-345
